## Abstract
...
# Methods implemented

*Uniform:* equal weights across all universes.

*BMA:* Bayesian Model Averaging weights computed from BIC (requires a bic column).

*MYH / MYNH:* regression-based decision sensitivity weighting (positive vs inverse weighting).

*MLI:* local-instability weighting using Gower distance over decision encodings.
